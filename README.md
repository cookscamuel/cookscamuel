### Hello! I'm Sam.

Since September 2023, I've been studying programming at Nova Scotia Community College. As of June 2025, I'll be gradutated and sent on my own to continue to nurture my passion for creating things. I like to make things simply for the joy of creation. I'm passionate about game development and helping others.

I grew up and spent most of my life on Nova Scotia's South Shore. My family and I lived in an old house in a small community called West Dublin, which is about half an hour away from Bridgewater, the closest major town for many kilometres. I've loved the outdoors ever since I was a kid, as I was lucky enough to grow up surrounded by nature and mere minutes away from provincial beaches. My younger brothers and I spent countless summers climbing trees and conquering our backyard, and established indestructible strongholds of snow every winter. When we weren't outdoors, we were glued to the television, fascinated by the many gaming consoles our parents had gathered over their lives.

Video games sparked my interest in technology, whether I was aware of it at the time or not. My mother was in posession of several classic game consoles, including the NES, N64, Game Boy Color, and PlayStation 2. While I had a blast exploring virtual worlds, conquering challenges, and experiencing things impossible to recreate in our world, I was fascinated by the question of how this could be possible. I could fathom how my action figures or stuffed animals were made by people, and I had an idea of how they made swingsets or playgrounds, but no matter how much I thought about it, I had no idea how someone could come up with the idea to create moving pictures on a screen that could be manipulated by a controller. For many years, I simply let it fascinate me, but when the time came for me to choose an area of study after high school, I chose programming so that I might learn how these kinds of programs are designed and built. It was one of the best decisions I have ever made.

At NSCC, I've had the privilege of learning through both theory lectures and hands-on experience. Fundamental skills were built with thought provoking discussions and examples, while skill building and practical learning were cemented with regular in-class actvities, assignments, and guidance from the talented instructors at the COGS campus. To date, I've completed numerous assignments and projects across an array of popular programming languages, learned to design, build, and maintain relational databases, and had thorough experience practicing software development life cycle and project management responsibilities and supporting software.

Below are some of my favourite projects I've had the pleasure of working on during my time at NSCC:

**React/Firebase Hangout Planning Web Application (beCurrent)**<br/>
I worked with two of my classmates (and best friends) for our program's final Capstone project to create a hangout planning web application with React and Firebase called beCurrent. The webapp was designed with our personal group of friends in mind, as it is intended to provide a way to organize thoughts for a hangout, coordinate carpooling and pickups, and keep everyone on the same page for what is needed to make a hangout happen, without all the clutter from unrelated social media posts or irrelevant features. The project is ongoing and not yet deployed, though working on it has greatly improved my understanding and programming abilities for React and Firebase integration.

**Laravel Inventory Management Web Application**<br/>
This was a project that had an incredibly brief development time limit. I had to learn, code, and debug at a rapid pace in order to meet the firm deadline. I had no prior experience using Laravel, but I managed to make things work. During that short period of development, I learned how to implement CRUD operations and work with a simple SQL database (including uploading images), handle GET and POST requests, and manage the routing and structure of a simple Laravel project. Though I was stressed, I had a lot of fun and learned a lot very quickly. I unfortunately did not get a chance to style the product, so while it was functional, it had a very basic design.

**Java Snake Game Modifications**<br/>
Our class was tasked with making specific modifications to the classic arcade game, Snake, in Java. We had to add game menus, obstacles, levels, and local co-op. On top of this, I added a shrinking play area to increase the difficulty and high-score saving with simple file IO to practice data persistence. Java Swing was used to render the game on screen. I learned a lot about asynchronous programming and going from code segments to graphics for users during the development of this project.

I pride myself on always trying my best, no matter the circumstances. I always try to look on the bright side of things and spread that mentality to the people around me. Family is the most important thing in the world to me, and that term stretches beyond just the people I'm related to. In every workplace and school I have been a part of, I always make sure that the people I share my life with feel proud to do the things they do and receive recognition when they are met with success. It is only together that we can achieve greatness.

You can find several repositories I've contributed to that are publicly available on my profile that span different legs of my learning journey; from in-class practice programs to more in-depth individual and group projects. I'm always looking for my next learning opportunity in this industry. I can't wait to see the ways that I can improve and grow as I continue on the path of becoming a knowledgeable and skilled developer.
